I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little
empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture
as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every
sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which
might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is
jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a
difficulty in laying his hands upon it.
