Errors are inevitable. Period. Sometimes things are not in your control—like server failures—and in this case you 
must have an error handling mechanism in place, which can catch the errors and show them to the users. 
Throughout the recipes in this chapter we have implemented callback functions that execute when a request is 
successful. It may happen (and I promise you it will happen) that you typed a filename incorrectly or the server 
encounters an error and you get an error rather thana successful response.
